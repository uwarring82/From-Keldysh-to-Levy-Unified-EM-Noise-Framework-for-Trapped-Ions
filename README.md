# From Keldysh to Lévy — Unified EM Noise Framework for Trapped Ions

This repository hosts the LaTeX source for our paper  
**“From Keldysh to Lévy: A Unified Framework for Electromagnetic Noise in Trapped Ions.”**

---

## 📘 Scope
The manuscript develops a cross-regime description of environmental noise affecting trapped ions,
bridging the Keldysh formalism with Lévy-type statistics.
It unifies **theory**, **scattering models**, and **inference protocols** into a coherent framework
for identifying noise sources and collision signatures in experiments.

## 🧭 Guardian Tier

This repository follows the Guardian Integrity Model:
1. Negative controls (null channels)
2. Statistical rigor (power & identifiability)
3. Immutable archival (artifact hashes)
4. Cross-validation (alternate estimators)

All validation logic is documented in
`sections/09_uncertainties_validation.tex`.
