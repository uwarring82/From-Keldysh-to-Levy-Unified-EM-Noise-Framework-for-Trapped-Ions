# From Keldysh to L√©vy ‚Äî Unified EM Noise Framework for Trapped Ions

This repository hosts the LaTeX source for our paper  
**‚ÄúFrom Keldysh to L√©vy: A Unified Framework for Electromagnetic Noise in Trapped Ions.‚Äù**

---

## üìò Scope
The manuscript develops a cross-regime description of environmental noise affecting trapped ions,
bridging the Keldysh formalism with L√©vy-type statistics.
It unifies **theory**, **scattering models**, and **inference protocols** into a coherent framework
for identifying noise sources and collision signatures in experiments.

## üß≠ Guardian Tier

This repository follows the Guardian Integrity Model:
1. Negative controls (null channels)
2. Statistical rigor (power & identifiability)
3. Immutable archival (artifact hashes)
4. Cross-validation (alternate estimators)

All validation logic is documented in
`sections/09_uncertainties_validation.tex`.
