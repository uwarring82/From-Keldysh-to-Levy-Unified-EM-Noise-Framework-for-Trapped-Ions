# Statistical Categorization of Motional Decoherence in Trapped Ions

## Mission Statement

**Problem**: Trapped-ion experiments suffer from multiple noise sources (field fluctuations, 
gas collisions, patch potentials, charging events). Current practice analyzes each source 
with different methods, and it's often unclear which measurements will identify which 
mechanisms.

**Solution**: We provide a first-principles categorization showing that *all* 
electromagnetically coupled noise falls into exactly three statistical categories 
(continuous, occasional, rare). Each category produces distinctive experimental signatures 
and requires specific measurement strategies.

**Deliverable**: A practical decision guide mapping noise characteristics → optimal 
measurements → required shot counts → inference protocols.

## What This Is

- **An experimental design guide** for noise characterization in trapped ions
- **A statistical categorization** connecting source physics to observable signatures  
- **A synthesis** of established open-quantum-systems theory applied to trapped-ion diagnostics
- **Complementary to empirical reviews** (e.g., Brownnutt 2015): explains *why* different 
  sources produce different signatures and *which* measurements distinguish them

## What This Is NOT

- A derivation of open quantum systems theory from first principles
- A general framework for all quantum systems (focus is trapped ions)
- A comprehensive review of all trapped-ion noise literature
- A proposal for new noise mitigation techniques (focus is characterization)

## Key Contributions

1. **Exhaustive categorization**: Three statistical universality classes (Gaussian/Poisson/Lévy) 
   based on event timing, not physical mechanism

2. **Decision parameter λτ**: Single dimensionless number (events per measurement) determines 
   which observables are informative

3. **Experimental discriminants** (Table 1): Observable signatures distinguishing mechanisms 
   with required shot counts for statistical power

4. **Scattering models**: Explicit connection from cross-sections (Langevin, hard-sphere, 
   charge exchange) to phonon-jump distributions

5. **Inference protocols**: Bayesian methods for mixed scenarios with multiple simultaneous 
   noise sources

6. **Validity boundaries**: When point-impulse approximations fail (fast scatterers, 
   extended coherence)

## Target Audience

**Primary**: Trapped-ion experimentalists designing noise characterization protocols  
**Secondary**: Theorists modeling decoherence in ion-trap quantum computers  
**Tertiary**: Precision metrology groups using trapped ions

**Prerequisites**: Undergraduate quantum mechanics, basic statistics, familiarity with 
trapped-ion systems. No prior knowledge of Keldysh formalism or Lévy processes required.

## How to Use This Framework

### If you're an experimentalist:

1. **Identify your regime**: Estimate λ (event rate) and τ (measurement time) → compute λτ
2. **Choose measurements**: Use Table 1 to select appropriate observables for your λτ regime
3. **Design protocol**: Section 8 gives shot counts and pulse sequences
4. **Fit models**: Section 4 connects your observables to physical parameters (cross-sections, 
   gas density, trap geometry)
5. **Validate**: Section 10 provides null-channel and cross-validation procedures

### If you're a theorist:

1. **Classify your noise source**: Dense/sparse/heavy-tailed based on microscopic physics
2. **Predict observables**: Use master equation (Sec. 3) to compute signatures
3. **Compare to experiment**: Use discriminants (Sec. 9) to test predictions

## Relation to Existing Literature

- **Brownnutt et al. (2015)**: Empirical catalog of measured heating rates and spectra  
  → *We complement this by explaining which measurements distinguish which sources*

- **Keldysh/Lévy open QS theory** (Holevo, Vacchini, Breuer & Petruccione):  
  → *We apply this established theory to trapped-ion noise characterization*

- **Collisional decoherence** (Hornberger, Vacchini):  
  → *We connect this to measurable phonon statistics in trapped ions*

- **Ion-trap noise measurements** (Turchette, Labaziewicz, Oghittu et al.):  
  → *We provide a unified framework for interpreting such measurements*
