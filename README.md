# Statistical Categorization of Motional Decoherence in Trapped Ions

## Mission Statement

**Problem**: Trapped-ion experiments suffer from multiple noise sources (field fluctuations, 
gas collisions, patch potentials, charging events). Current practice analyzes each source 
with different methods, and it's often unclear which measurements will identify which 
mechanisms.

**Solution**: We provide a first-principles categorization showing that *all* 
electromagnetically coupled noise falls into exactly three statistical categories 
(continuous, occasional, rare). Each category produces distinctive experimental signatures 
and requires specific measurement strategies.

**Deliverable**: A practical decision guide mapping noise characteristics → optimal 
measurements → required shot counts → inference protocols.

## What This Is

- **An experimental design guide** for noise characterization in trapped ions
- **A statistical categorization** connecting source physics to observable signatures  
- **A synthesis** of established open-quantum-systems theory applied to trapped-ion diagnostics
- **Complementary to empirical reviews** (e.g., Brownnutt 2015): explains *why* different 
  sources produce different signatures and *which* measurements distinguish them

## What This Is NOT

- A derivation of open quantum systems theory from first principles
- A general framework for all quantum systems (focus is trapped ions)
- A comprehensive review of all trapped-ion noise literature
- A proposal for new noise mitigation techniques (focus is characterization)

- **Scope:** Practical, experiment-driven framework for trapped-ion EM noise.
  We acknowledge the universal L\'evy--Khintchine structure but do not develop general qubit/optomechanics theory here.

## Key Contributions

1. **Exhaustive categorization**: Three statistical universality classes (Gaussian/Poisson/Lévy) 
   based on event timing, not physical mechanism

2. **Decision parameter λτ**: Single dimensionless number (events per measurement) determines 
   which observables are informative

3. **Experimental discriminants** (Table 1): Observable signatures distinguishing mechanisms 
   with required shot counts for statistical power

4. **Scattering models**: Explicit connection from cross-sections (Langevin, hard-sphere, 
   charge exchange) to phonon-jump distributions

5. **Inference protocols**: Bayesian methods for mixed scenarios with multiple simultaneous 
   noise sources

6. **Validity boundaries**: When point-impulse approximations fail (fast scatterers, 
   extended coherence)

## Target Audience

**Primary**: Trapped-ion experimentalists designing noise characterization protocols  
**Secondary**: Theorists modeling decoherence in ion-trap quantum computers  
**Tertiary**: Precision metrology groups using trapped ions

**Prerequisites**: Undergraduate quantum mechanics, basic statistics, familiarity with 
trapped-ion systems. No prior knowledge of Keldysh formalism or Lévy processes required.

## How to Use This Framework

### If you're an experimentalist:

1. **Identify your regime**: Estimate λ (event rate) and τ (measurement time) → compute λτ
2. **Choose measurements**: Use Table 1 to select appropriate observables for your λτ regime
3. **Design protocol**: Section 8 gives shot counts and pulse sequences
4. **Fit models**: Section 4 connects your observables to physical parameters (cross-sections, 
   gas density, trap geometry)
5. **Validate**: Section 10 provides null-channel and cross-validation procedures

### If you're a theorist:

1. **Classify your noise source**: Dense/sparse/heavy-tailed based on microscopic physics
2. **Predict observables**: Use master equation (Sec. 3) to compute signatures
3. **Compare to experiment**: Use discriminants (Sec. 9) to test predictions

## Relation to Existing Literature

- **Brownnutt et al. (2015)**: Empirical catalog of measured heating rates and spectra  
  → *We complement this by explaining which measurements distinguish which sources*

- **Keldysh/Lévy open QS theory** (Holevo, Vacchini, Breuer & Petruccione):  
  → *We apply this established theory to trapped-ion noise characterization*

- **Collisional decoherence** (Hornberger, Vacchini):  
  → *We connect this to measurable phonon statistics in trapped ions*

- **Ion-trap noise measurements** (Turchette, Labaziewicz, Oghittu et al.):  
  → *We provide a unified framework for interpreting such measurements*

# Numerical Validation: Two-Pillar Structure

## Overview

We validate the unified EM-noise framework through two independent, complementary tests that separate statistical inference from physical modeling. The Brownnutt et al. (2015) review concludes that ion trap heating mechanisms remain "poorly understood" despite 15+ years of study. Multiple candidate mechanisms (patch potentials, adatom dipoles, two-level fluctuators) produce overlapping experimental signatures, making source identification challenging. Our framework provides discriminants to separate Gaussian vs Poisson vs Lévy statistics, but these must be validated numerically before experimental application. Our two-pillar validation (classification power + Green tensor accuracy) ensures the framework's discriminants have sufficient power to separate mechanisms in realistic experimental conditions.
---

## Pillar 1: Classification Power (Pure Statistics)

**Question**: *Can experimental discriminants distinguish noise regimes with realistic sample sizes?*

**What we test**:
- Given **perfect knowledge** of noise sources (λ, S_F(ω), ν(Δp))
- Generate synthetic stroboscopic measurements (N shots)
- Apply discriminants: skewness κ₃, waiting-time distributions, Allan variance
- Classify regime as Gaussian, Poisson, or Lévy

**Success criteria**:
- ✅ Confusion matrix diagonal >90% for N ≥ 10⁴ shots
- ✅ Crossover regime (λτ ~ 1) correctly identified
- ✅ Minimum shot counts documented for 3σ separation

**What this validates**: The framework's **information content**—whether the proposed observables actually distinguish mechanisms.

**What it catches**: Under-sampling, statistical artifacts, insufficient discriminant power.

---

## Pillar 2: Green Tensor Accuracy (Physical Predictions)

**Question**: *Does the electromagnetic coupling model correctly predict heating rates and cross-sections?*

**What we test**:
- Compute Green tensor G(r₀,r;ω) for realistic trap geometry
- Predict heating rate Γ_heat from Johnson noise spectrum
- Predict collision cross-sections σ from scattering theory
- Compare to literature benchmarks (Brownnutt et al., Oghittu et al.)

**Success criteria**:
- ✅ Heating rate predictions within factor of 2 of measurements
- ✅ Cross-section predictions within 20% of literature
- ✅ Geometry sensitivity (±10% perturbations) quantified
- ✅ Dominant systematic uncertainties documented

**What this validates**: The framework's **physical accuracy**—whether Maxwell equations + trap geometry + scattering models reproduce observed effects.

**What it catches**: Wrong source model, geometry errors, incorrect cross-sections, missing mechanisms.

## Why Two Pillars?

| Failure Mode | Pillar 1 Detects | Pillar 2 Detects |
|--------------|------------------|------------------|
| Insufficient statistics | ✓ | — |
| Wrong noise classification | ✓ | — |
| Wrong absolute rate | — | ✓ |
| Geometry errors | — | ✓ |
| Additional mechanisms (e.g., outgassing) | ✓ (non-stationarity) | ✓ (rate mismatch) |
| Coherent pickup (e.g., 60 Hz) | ✓ (periodic Allan variance) | ✓ (spectral line) |

**Complementary coverage**: Pillar 1 catches *statistical* failures; Pillar 2 catches *systematic* failures.

**Total uncertainty**: σ²_total = σ²_stat + σ²_sys (requires both pillars)

## Guardian Certification Criterion

✅ Framework is **validated** when:
1. Pillar 1 achieves >90% classification accuracy across tested regimes
2. Pillar 2 predictions agree with literature within stated uncertainties
3. Both pillars independently confirm regime classification for test cases

❌ Framework **fails validation** if:
- Confusion matrix shows systematic misclassification (e.g., Gaussian tails classified as Poisson)
- Green tensor predictions disagree with measurements by >2×
- Geometry sensitivity >50% (manufacturing tolerances dominate)

## Outputs

**For users of the framework**:
- Regime map with confidence boundaries
- Minimum shot requirements per (λτ, α)
- Uncertainty budget: statistical vs systematic contributions
- Decision boundaries for experimental classification

**For flyby detection**:

*Protective Principle*: "Validate what you can measure (statistics) separately from what you can model (physics)—errors hide where the two meet."
