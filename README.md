# From Keldysh to Lévy — Unified EM Noise Framework for Trapped Ions

This repository hosts the LaTeX source for our paper  
**“From Keldysh to Lévy: A Unified Framework for Electromagnetic Noise in Trapped Ions.”**

---

## 📘 Scope
The manuscript develops a cross-regime description of environmental noise affecting trapped ions,
bridging the Keldysh formalism with Lévy-type statistics.
It unifies **theory**, **scattering models**, and **inference protocols** into a coherent framework
for identifying noise sources and collision signatures in experiments.

- **Scope:** Practical, experiment-driven framework for trapped-ion EM noise.
  We acknowledge the universal L\'evy--Khintchine structure but do not develop general qubit/optomechanics theory here.

## 🧭 Guardian Tier

This repository follows the Guardian Integrity Model:
1. Negative controls (null channels)
2. Statistical rigor (power & identifiability)
3. Immutable archival (artifact hashes)
4. Cross-validation (alternate estimators)

All validation logic is documented in
`sections/09_uncertainties_validation.tex`.

## 📝 Terminology Policy

We use \emph{motional decoherence} as the umbrella term for any process that
reduces the purity of an ion’s motional state, encompassing both heating
(energy exchange driven by near-resonant force noise) and dephasing (phase
diffusion from slow potential variations). The explicit terms “heating” and
“dephasing” are retained when discussing spectral origins (e.g.\
$S_E(\omega_t)$ vs.\ low-frequency $S_{\delta\omega}$ or $S_E(0)$), the
structure of the master-equation generators ($\mathcal{D}_G$ vs.\
$\mathcal{J}_P$), or discriminants that isolate a single channel.
