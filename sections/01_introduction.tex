\section{Introduction}
Trapped ions are among the most sensitive probes of weak electromagnetic fields.
Understanding and controlling their motional heating has been central since the earliest quantum logic and precision spectroscopy experiments~\cite{Turchette2000,Wineland1998}.
Traditionally, heating is modeled through spectral densities of electric field fluctuations $S_E(\omega)$, inferred by relating the ion's motional excitation rate to the environmental noise spectrum.
This framework has successfully explained technical noise sources, Johnson noise in electrodes, and surface-potential fluctuations~\cite{Brownnutt2015}.
However, a complementary mechanism arises from discrete collision events: background gas flybys or scattering particles that impart sudden momentum kicks.
These cannot be captured by Gaussian noise models alone.
Instead, they produce intermittent heating signatures that are invisible to $S_E(\omega)$ alone.

We present here a unifying framework where both continuous noise and discrete collisions are subsumed into the language of stochastic currents $\mathbf{J}(\mathbf{r},t)$ mediated to the ion through the electromagnetic Green tensor $\mathbf{G}(\mathbf{r}_0,\mathbf{r};\omega)$.
As illustrated schematically in Fig.~\ref{fig:em_mediation}, all differences reduce to the statistical character of the source currents: dense Gaussian baths vs.~sparse Poisson impulses.

  All heating mechanisms—technical field noise and collisional impulses—couple to the trapped ion through the electromagnetic Green tensor $\mathbf{G}(\mathbf{r}_0,\mathbf{r};\omega)$ acting on stochastic current sources $\mathbf{J}(\mathbf{r},t)$.
  The distinction between Gaussian diffusion ($\mathcal{D}_G$) and compound-Poisson jumps ($\mathcal{J}_P$) arises from the statistical character of $\mathbf{J}$: dense sources yield Gaussian $S_{JJ}$, while sparse fly-by events produce a L\'evy measure $\nu(\Delta p)$ over momentum kicks.}

The theoretical development shows how integrating out the EM environment within the Keldysh formalism naturally yields a L\'evy--Khintchine form of the ion's master equation~\cite{Sornette2006}: Gaussian diffusion plus compound-Poisson jumps.
The experimental consequences are developed and we outline discriminants that separate Gaussian from non-Gaussian heating, introduce explicit scattering models, and provide inference protocols.
We also identify when the point-impulse approximation breaks down: for fast scatterers with trajectory extent comparable to the trap dimension, the spatial structure of $\mathbf{G}(\mathbf{r})$ induces directional and anisotropic heating.
