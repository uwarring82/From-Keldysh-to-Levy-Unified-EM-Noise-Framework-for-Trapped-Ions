\section{Introduction}
Trapped ions are among the most sensitive probes of weak electromagnetic fields.
Understanding and controlling their motional heating has been central since the earliest quantum logic and precision spectroscopy experiments~\cite{Turchette2000,Wineland1998}.
Traditionally, heating is modeled through spectral densities of electric field fluctuations $S_E(\omega)$, inferred by relating the ion's motional excitation rate to the environmental noise spectrum.
This framework has successfully explained technical noise sources, Johnson noise in electrodes, and surface-potential fluctuations~\cite{Brownnutt2015}.
However, a complementary mechanism arises from discrete collision events: background gas flybys or scattering particles that impart sudden momentum kicks.
These cannot be captured by Gaussian noise models alone.
Instead, they produce intermittent heating signatures that are invisible to $S_E(\omega)$ alone.

\paragraph{Positioning (complementary to empirical reviews).}
Empirical surveys such as Brownnutt \emph{et al.} (2015)~\cite{Brownnutt2015} map the experimental
landscape via field spectra $S_E(\omega)$ and heating rates; they are descriptive
and data--driven. Our aim here is \emph{first principles categorization}:
to explain why distinct microscopic mechanisms \emph{must} yield distinct
\emph{statistical} signatures in ion heating, and to identify the observables
that separate them most powerfully.

\paragraph{Unifying idea.}
All mechanisms couple through the same electromagnetic Green tensor
$G(\mathbf r_0,\mathbf r;\omega)$ that encodes trap geometry and materials.
What differs is the \emph{statistics of the source currents} $J(\mathbf r,t)$.
Dense, weakly coupled sources $\Rightarrow$ Gaussian statistics (CLT) and
Lindblad diffusion; rare, independent impulses $\Rightarrow$ compound--Poisson
jumps with rate $\lambda$ and jump distribution set by scattering physics;
heavy--tailed outliers give L\'evy--stable behavior. The mediation by $G$ is
universal; the categorization rests on the statistics of $J$.

\paragraph{Predictive consequence for experiments.}
A single dimensionless control parameter, $\lambda\tau$ (event rate $\lambda$,
interrogation time $\tau$), selects the informative observables:
$\lambda\tau\gg1$ favors spectral methods; $\lambda\tau\sim1$ calls for higher
cumulants and Allan variance; $\lambda\tau\ll1$ exposes waiting--time statistics
and jump-size histograms. Table~\ref{tab:discriminants} summarizes this
\emph{decision map}; Sec.~\ref{sec:inference_protocol} provides a stroboscopic
protocol sized for statistical power.

Both motional heating from electromagnetic field fluctuations and
dephasing from collisional perturbations can be derived within the general
framework of translation-covariant open-system dynamics.
In macroscopic QED, field-noise-induced diffusion arises from the
fluctuation--dissipation relation, where the electric-field spectral
density $S_E(\omega)$ is determined by the dyadic electromagnetic Green
tensor of the trap environment
\cite{ScheelBuhmann2008,BrownnuttRMP2015,BuhmannDispersionForcesII}.
Conversely, stochastic momentum kicks from residual gas follow from the
quantum linear Boltzmann equation and the broader theory of collisional
decoherence
\cite{HornbergerSipe2003,VacchiniHornberger2009,OghittuNJPhys2023}.
These two mechanisms correspond, respectively, to the Gaussian and
compound-Poisson components of the general
L\'evy--Khintchine generator established for
translation-covariant quantum Markov semigroups
\cite{Holevo1993,VacchiniJMathPhys2001}.
Under standard weak-coupling and Markov approximations, their additive
combination is rigorously justified
\cite{BreuerPetruccione2002}.
This connection situates the present framework within established
open-quantum-system theory while clarifying that its novelty lies in
integrating these results into a unified description tailored to
trapped-ion experiments.

We present here a unifying framework where both continuous noise and discrete collisions are subsumed into the language of stochastic currents $\mathbf{J}(\mathbf{r},t)$ mediated to the ion through the electromagnetic Green tensor $G(\mathbf{r}_0,\mathbf{r};\omega)$.
As illustrated schematically in Fig.~\ref{fig:em_mediation}, all differences reduce to the statistical character of the source currents: dense Gaussian baths vs.~sparse Poisson impulses.

  \caption{\textbf{Unified EM-mediated noise framework.}
  All heating mechanisms—technical field noise and collisional impulses—couple to the trapped ion through the electromagnetic Green tensor $G(\mathbf{r}_0,\mathbf{r};\omega)$ acting on stochastic current sources $\mathbf{J}(\mathbf{r},t)$.
  The distinction between Gaussian diffusion ($\mathcal{D}_G$) and compound-Poisson jumps ($\mathcal{J}_P$) arises from the statistical character of $\mathbf{J}$: dense sources yield Gaussian $S_{JJ}$, while sparse fly-by events produce a Lévy measure $\nu(\Delta p)$ over momentum kicks.}

The theoretical development shows how integrating out the EM environment within the Keldysh formalism naturally yields a Lévy–Khintchine form of the ion's master equation~\cite{Sornette2006}: Gaussian diffusion plus compound-Poisson jumps.
The experimental consequences are developed and we outline discriminants that separate Gaussian from non-Gaussian heating, introduce explicit scattering models, and provide inference protocols.
We also identify when the point-impulse approximation breaks down: for fast scatterers with trajectory extent comparable to the trap dimension, the spatial structure of $G(\mathbf{r})$ induces directional and anisotropic heating.
