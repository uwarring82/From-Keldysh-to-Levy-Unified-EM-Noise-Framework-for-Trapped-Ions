\section{Noise Regimes and Motional Responses}
\label{sec:noise_regimes}

Environmental fluctuations couple to a trapped ion’s harmonic motion either
as effectively continuous fields or as discrete impulses.  Both arise from
stochastic current sources $J(\mathbf r,t)$ and are mediated by the trap’s
electromagnetic Green tensor $G(\mathbf r_0,\mathbf r;\omega)$.

To classify temporal statistics we use the dimensionless product
$\lambda\tau$, which counts independent events within one experimental
interrogation time~$\tau$.  For impulsive processes $\lambda$ denotes the
Poisson rate of discrete events; for continuous Gaussian fields,
$\lambda^{-1}$ represents an effective correlation time $\tau_c$, so that
$\lambda\tau\!\sim\!\tau/\tau_c$ measures the number of independent
fluctuation intervals.  \emph{Crucially, $\lambda\tau$ characterizes event
statistics, not the frequency content of the noise spectrum.}
Heating and dephasing depend on \emph{spectral weight} at different
frequencies, independent of whether the statistics are diffusive or sparse.

%----------------------------------------
\paragraph{Diffusive regime ($\lambda\tau\!\gg\!1$).}
Many independent fluctuations accumulate and the central-limit theorem
applies: force statistics are well described by a Gaussian process.
The ion’s energy changes at a rate set by the near-resonant spectral weight
of the force noise filtered by the mechanical susceptibility
$\chi(\omega)$ (derived in Sec.~\ref{sec:theory_foundations}):
\[
\frac{d\langle n\rangle}{dt}
 = \frac{1}{4 m \hbar \omega_t}\!\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\!
   |\chi(\omega)|^{2} S_F(\omega)\,d\omega,
\qquad S_F(\omega)=q^{2}S_E(\omega).
\]
The process is statistically Gaussian, but this says nothing about phase
coherence: dephasing can be strong if low-frequency spectral weight is large
(e.g.\ $1/f$ noise), and weak if such weight is small.

%----------------------------------------
\paragraph{Intermediate regime ($\lambda\tau\!\sim\!1$).}
Only a few fluctuations occur within~$\tau$.  The motion alternates between
free evolution and discrete perturbations, producing non-Gaussian
statistics with measurable higher-order cumulants and characteristic
roll-overs in the Allan variance.  Each impulse contributes \emph{both}
energy change and a phase shift, so heating and dephasing coexist.
This regime is particularly diagnostic of underlying source statistics
(cf.\ Sec.~\ref{sec:discriminants_summary}).

%----------------------------------------
\paragraph{Sparse regime ($\lambda\tau\!\ll\!1$).}
Isolated impulses are resolvable in time with exponential waiting-time
distribution $p(t)=\lambda e^{-\lambda t}$.  Between impulses the oscillator
evolves coherently; each rare impulse applies a finite displacement in
phase space, producing a discrete energy jump together with a phase reset.
The observables are step-like heating and discrete, resolvable phase
discontinuities.

\subsection*{Heating and Dephasing Channels: Spectral View and Operators}

Environmental noise modifies (i) the \emph{energy} of the oscillator
(heating) and (ii) the \emph{phase} of its coherent motion (dephasing).
These effects are controlled by different parts of the spectrum of the
electric field at the ion.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Heating (energy exchange).}
  With $H_\mathrm{int}=-q x E(t)$, the heating rate is determined by the
  force-noise spectrum $S_F(\omega)=q^2 S_E(\omega)$ filtered by the
  mechanical susceptibility $|\chi(\omega)|^{2}$.  In the high-$Q$ limit the
  integral above reduces to the familiar near-resonant expression
  $\dot{\langle n\rangle}\!\approx\! (q^{2}/4m\hbar\omega_t)\,S_E(\omega_t)$.
  Off-resonant spectral weight contributes according to
  $|\chi(\omega)|^{2}$ and should not be neglected when linewidths are broad
  or spectra structured.

  \item \textbf{Dephasing (phase diffusion without energy exchange).}
  Slow fluctuations of the trapping potential or stray fields modulate the
  instantaneous frequency
  $\omega_t\!\rightarrow\!\omega_t+\delta\omega(t)$,
  producing a random phase
  $\phi(t)=\int_{0}^{t}\delta\omega(t')\,dt'.$
  The coherence of a motional superposition decays as
  $\exp[-\tfrac{1}{2}\langle(\Delta\phi)^{2}\rangle]$, with
  \[
    \langle(\Delta\phi)^{2}\rangle
      = 2\!\int_{0}^{\infty}\! S_{\delta\omega}(\Omega)
        \!\left(\frac{\sin(\Omega t/2)}{\Omega/2}\right)^{2}\! d\Omega .
  \]
  For a harmonic trap potential $U\!\propto\!x^{2}$, stray-field
  fluctuations $\delta E(t)$ shift the trap frequency as
  $\delta\omega(t)\!\propto\!\delta E(t)/x_{0}$,
  so the spectrum $S_{\delta\omega}(\Omega)$ traces the
  low-frequency limit of the electric-field noise $S_{E}(\Omega)$.
  In the Markov limit $S_{\delta\omega}(0)$ defines an exponential
  dephasing time~$T_{\phi}$, while quasi-static noise produces Gaussian
  decay in time.
\end{itemize}

\noindent\textbf{Unified impulse picture.}
A single momentum impulse implements the unitary displacement
$U_{\Delta p}=\exp[-i\,\Delta p\,x/\hbar]$,
which simultaneously increases energy and shifts the phase of the coherent
state.  Accordingly, it is incorrect to assign ``kicks~$\rightarrow$~heating''
and ``timing~$\rightarrow$~dephasing'' to separate channels; both arise from
the same operator action, while their \emph{observed balance} is governed by
the spectral content of $S_E(\omega)$ and the trap’s susceptibility.

\medskip
\noindent\textbf{Summary.}
The parameter $\lambda\tau$ organizes temporal statistics
(diffusive~$\leftrightarrow$~sparse), whereas heating and dephasing are set by
\emph{which} parts of the spectrum carry power:
near~$\omega_t$ for heating and near~0 for dephasing.
Either contribution can dominate in any regime.
