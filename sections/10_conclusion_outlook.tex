\section{Conclusion and Outlook}
We have outlined a unified electromagnetic-noise framework that connects microscopic Keldysh treatments with macroscopic L\'evy statistics for trapped ions.
Future work will extend these models to multi-ion crystals, integrate real-time Bayesian controllers, and benchmark against surface-electrode experiments with engineered scatterer fluxes.
